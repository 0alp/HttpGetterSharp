            Closes the current HTTP connection by closing and disposing the underlying stream and client.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This method ensures that all data in the stream is read before closing the connection.
            It performs a half-close operation on the stream and disposes of the resources safely.
            It terminates the connection according to the TCP standard by sending the FIN bit instead of RST.
